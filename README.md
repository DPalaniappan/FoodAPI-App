# FoodAPI-App

FoodApi is a versatile food application built with React.js, leveraging state management, CSS, and HTML to deliver a seamless user experience. It harnesses the power of the Spoonacular API to provide users with access to a vast database of foods and their recipes. This was another small project to gain more experience with React.js and learning how to use useState and useEffect hooks.
